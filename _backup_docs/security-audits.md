# Security & Audits

## Principles
- Minimal trusted roles; no hidden admin backdoors.  
- Defense in depth: audits + bounties + monitoring.

## Oracles
- Redundant providers with medianization, staleness checks, and deviation guards.

## Risk Engine
- Explicit invariants and circuit breakers.  
- Emergency pause governed by multi‑sig with time‑locked scope.

## Audits & Bounties
- External audits (CertiK/Quantstamp etc.) prior to mainnet.  
- Public bug bounty with scope and rewards schedule.
