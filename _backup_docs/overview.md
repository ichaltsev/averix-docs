# Overview

## Introduction
Averix is a **decentralized prop‑trading and copy‑trading ecosystem** that merges traditional proprietary trading mechanics with Web3 tokenomics and **on‑chain risk management**. Traders access funded accounts by staking the TFT token for tiered benefits and operate in a transparent, algorithmic, and rules‑enforced environment governed by smart contracts.

Unlike centralized prop firms with opaque rules and manual oversight, Averix executes rules and payouts on‑chain for **fairness, verifiability, and instant settlement**.

## Vision & Mission
**Vision:** Redefine prop‑trading through a decentralized, transparent, reward‑driven ecosystem that empowers traders, investors, and communities.

**Mission:**
- Reward skill, discipline, and consistency.  
- Enable passive income through copy pools and staking.  
- Replace subjective trust with blockchain transparency.  
- Provide AI‑assisted risk management to protect capital.

## Core Principles
1. **Transparency First:** Rules, trades, and payouts are encoded in smart contracts.  
2. **Fair Competition:** No hidden metrics or manual disqualifications.  
3. **Capital Efficiency:** Liquidity flows between staking and copy pools based on programmatic weights.  
4. **Risk Management:** Each position is evaluated by the on‑chain Risk Engine.  
5. **Community Governance:** Token holders influence protocol evolution.  
6. **Progression:** Achievements and season NFTs reflect verified performance.
