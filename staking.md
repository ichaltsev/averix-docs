## Tiers
Staking TFT unlocks access/benefits. Example tiers (adjustable via governance):

| Tier | Stake (TFT) | Leverage Cap | Fees Discount | Copy Pool Access |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Bronze | 1,000 | 3× | 5% | Read‑only |
| Silver | 5,000 | 5× | 10% | Deposit |
| Gold | 20,000 | 7× | 15% | Deposit + Priority |
| Prime | 100,000 | 10× | 20% | All features |

## Mechanics
- Stake/unstake with cooldown and exit fees to protect liquidity.  
- On‑chain tier proofs for dApp gating.  
- Optional boost multipliers for long‑term locks.

## Rewards
- Share of protocol fees.  
- Trader rewards passthrough based on weighted activity.  
- Boosts for consistent non‑violating behavior.

## Cooldown & Slashing
- Early unstake fees to prevent mercenary flow.  
- Extreme violation events can slash a portion of boosted rewards (never principal).
