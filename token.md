title: TFT Token
---
## Overview
**TFT** powers access tiers, governance, and fee‑sharing. It is deflationary by design through protocol sinks.

## Utilities
- **Staking:** Unlocks Bronze → Prime access, fee discounts, and copy‑pool eligibility.
- **Governance:** Vote on proposals, parameter changes, treasury allocations.
- **Rewards Medium:** Distributed to traders, stakers, and copy liquidity providers.
- **Fee Unit:** Portions of protocol fees are denominated or rebated in TFT.

## Governance
- **1 TFT = 1 vote** (can be time‑weighted or delegated).  
- Snapshot‑style off‑chain voting with on‑chain execution, or direct on‑chain votes for critical items.

## Deflationary Mechanics
- Buy‑back & burn from protocol fees and penalty pools.  
- NFT minting/badges can require nominal TFT fees (burn).

## Supply & Allocation
Total supply capped at **1,000,000,000 TFT** (example; adjust per final spec).

| Allocation | Percent |
|---|---:|
| Trader Rewards | 35% |
| Staking & Copy Pools | 15% |
| Ecosystem/Partnerships | 15% |
| Treasury/Operations | 10% |
| Liquidity | 10% |
| Team | 8% |
| Airdrop/Referrals | 7% |

## Vesting & Emissions
- Team/Advisors: cliff + linear vesting (e.g., 12m cliff, 36m linear).  
- Rewards: epoch‑based emissions with halving‑style decay.  
- Liquidity: bootstrap + strategic market operations.

## Contract Addresses & Audit
Addresses published post‑deployment. Third‑party audits (e.g., CertiK/Quantstamp) before mainnet.
