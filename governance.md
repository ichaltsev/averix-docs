# Governance

## DAO Model
Hybrid: off‑chain signaling (Snapshot‑like) with on‑chain execution. Critical operations require on‑chain voting and delay.

## Proposal Lifecycle
1. Forum discussion & temperature check.  
2. Draft AIP (Averix Improvement Proposal).  
3. Snapshot vote (or direct on‑chain, if required).  
4. Timelock + execution by guardians/multisig.

## Voting Power
- 1 TFT = 1 vote; optional lock‑time multiplier.  
- Delegation supported.

## Treasury
Multi‑sig with quorum and rotation. Spending requires governance approval except for whitelisted ops budgets.
